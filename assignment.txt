The purpose of the script is to have the ability to process configuration file FW_1238.conf to extract relevant information in an autom√†tic way and generate a report file with a format similar to the one in Report.DOC or Report.PDF

The report file could be a PDF file, a DOC file or an HTML file. Before using any other formats (ask lecturer about)

The content of the file must have static text, but also dynamic text (extracted from the configuration file) (the text in yellow)

The text in blue will help you to locate the relevant information on the configuration file

The script should ask for the source configuration file and write the report for that file
